# haskell_netpbm
Some simple haskell code I wrote to experiment with rasterization using netpbm image formats

Currently it supports parsing image files and can print information about them.

Planned features:
  Converting between NetPbm formats
  generating an image
  saving an image
  transforming an existing image
